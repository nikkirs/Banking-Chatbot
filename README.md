# Banking-Chatbot
Assumptions
- I trained the chatbot myself by using IBM Watson. So this is very basic web app.
- You can greet,ask the information about branches, transfer money, change password, open account, give feedback, make payment, call representative and much more.
- I used NodeJS for backend.
- I've optimized it for the mobile also.
- I've attached the JSON file of training model for reference.
- You can use this web app by typing https://chatbotforbanking.herokuapp.com/

How to run this app in localhost
- Go to command prompt and clone this folder.
- Type cd Banking-Chatbot.
- Type npm install. This will install all the libraries.
- Type node index.js. This will start the server.
- Then go to browser and type http://localhost:3000/
- The chatbot will be shown.

Thank you for this opportunity.I will look forward to hearing from you.
